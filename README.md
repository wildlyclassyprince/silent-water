# silent-water

***

`silent-water` aims to:

1. manage the data engineering lifecycle of open source data sets that I find interesting; and
2. serve as proof of concept for setting up an ETL project using the open data stack.

***

## Setup

From the commandline, run:
```cmd
bash run.sh
```
This will setup the repo. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the Dagster UI.

Create all assets by clicking on __Materialize All__.
